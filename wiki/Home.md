## cshell(1) Manual Page

### Name

ConShell - a broken productivity app

### About

ConShell is the game engine for those who mainly program PowerShell scripts and modules.

A workspace is where all the code for each game goes into - enough to make a classic retro game. For more information about workspaces in CShell, see the [`games` directory - Manual page](workspace).

### Features

* Each game is in a single file in the CSH workspace.

* Make it end by adding some `exit` to your script file.

* Play audio at anytime - might be possible in PowerShell.
